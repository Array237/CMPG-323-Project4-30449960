# Description of Project
For this project we had to use UiPath/RPA to automate testing of a webpage/WebApi. Testing can be tedious and RPA allows us to automate the process and complete the testing faster than most humans could. We read data that we want to use from an excel file and iteratively use that data to populate input fields and can navigate webpage with this data.

# How to Use
To use this project, you need to have UiPath studio installed on your machine or have a robot linked to your machine and hosting account to run the RPA. To run locally from UiPath studio, you need to clone the repository and locate the files in UiPath studio. If you dont have access to assest that populates the login boxes, you can create an account on the web page and popuate login boxes with your credintials to automatically login.
